Assignment 2
Dylan Eickmeyer 
I chsoe to take Intro to Web Designe because I've enjoyed media arts classes that I have taken at the University so far. I look forward to expanding my knowledge and learning more about the web and what it has to offer. I am excited to unlock and learn about the places and things that come along with the internet.
